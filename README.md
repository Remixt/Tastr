# Tastr
Team Project for CS4444: Software Engineering

## Tastr is an Android App that allows users to decide what they want to eat instead of where.
Have you ever been to a new Restaraunt that looked great in your head, but once you got there their menu didn't have anything you would want? 

If you answered yes to any of the questions above, Tastr is for you.
